# Multiplayer Game Communication System API Guidelines
---
## Introduction
### The Multiplayer Game Communication System API Guidelines are designed to provide a structure for the development of multiplayer games. These guidelines outline a file and folder structure and provide guidance for client-server communication, security considerations, and best practices for module development.

## File and Folder Structure
### The following file and folder structure is recommended for a multiplayer game communication system:
```
Server
Private/
    index.lua (entry point for the server)
    modules/
        events.lua (module for server-side events)
        functions.lua (module for server-side functions)
    services/
        database.lua (module for handling database interactions)
    assets/
         [various assets]

Shared/
    modules/
        utils.lua (module for commonly used utility functions)
        pathfinding.lua (module for pathfinding algorithms)
        physics.lua (module for handling physics and collisions)
        sound.lua (module for playing sound effects and music)
        animation.lua (module for controlling character animations)
        calculations.lua (module for shared calculations)
        
Client

index.lua (entry point for the client)
modules/
    events.lua (module for client-side events)
    functions.lua (module for client-side functions)
    calculations.lua (module for shared calculations)
services/
    server.lua (module for communicating with the server)
ui/
    [various UI elements]
```

## Communication System
### The following guidelines outline the recommended communication system for a multiplayer game:
* Each client will be assigned its own event and function listener objects.
* These listeners will also be used by the server to listen for signals from the assigned client.
* These listeners will also be used by the client to listen for signals from the server.
* If these listeners are used by another client, this means there has been a security breach. Deny this request and BAN the client which accessed a private listener.
* The server will have a honeypot containing signals with listeners which BAN the requester. Use names such as “Give Money”, “Kill All”, “Admin”. BAN any client which * invokes these listeners.
## Security Considerations
### The following security considerations should be taken into account when developing a multiplayer game:
* Validate the caller's token and event existence before allowing the caller to invoke a function.
* If the caller and event are not valid, kick the caller for attempting to exploit.
* If the caller does not match the player, kick them for attempting to exploit.
* Validate the caller's token and calculation existence before allowing the caller to invoke a calculation.
* If the caller and calculation are not valid, kick the caller for attempting to exploit.
* If a client attempts to use a private listener, deny the request and ban the client.
## Best Practices for Module Development
### The following best practices should be followed when developing modules for a multiplayer game:
* Use a consistent naming convention for modules, functions, and events.
* Place modules in the appropriate folder structure based on their functionality.
* Avoid global variables as they can cause issues with variable scope and conflicts.
* Use the return statement to return values from functions and calculations.
* Use comments to explain the purpose and functionality of functions and calculations.

## Conclusion
The Multiplayer Game Communication System API Guidelines provide a structure for developing multiplayer games. Following these guidelines will help ensure that your game is secure, scalable, and easy to maintain.

## What is a BindableEvent?
A BindableEvent is a type of Roblox object that allows you to create an event that can be listened to by other objects in your game. You can think of a BindableEvent as a way for different parts of your game to communicate with each other.

## Why use a BindableEvent to offload heavy AI calculations to clients?
In a Roblox game with a lot of AI, it can be very resource-intensive to perform all of the necessary calculations on the server. By using a BindableEvent to offload some of these calculations to clients, you can reduce the amount of strain on your server and improve overall game performance.

## How does it work?
Here's an example of how you can use a BindableEvent to offload heavy AI calculations to clients:

Create a BindableEvent in your server script. This event will be used to send calculation requests to clients.
```
local calculateListener = Instance.new("BindableEvent")
calculateListener.Name = "CalculateListener"
calculateListener.Parent = game.ServerScriptService
Create a function in your client script that will listen for calculation requests from the server.
lua
Copy code
local function onCalculateRequest(caller, functionName, ...)
    -- Perform the necessary calculation using the provided arguments
    local result = performCalculation(...)
    
    -- Send the result back to the server
    return result
end
```
Connect the function to the BindableEvent in your client script.
```
calculateListener.Event:Connect(onCalculateRequest)
```
In your server script, when you need to perform a heavy AI calculation, call the BindableEvent and pass in the necessary arguments.
```
calculateListener:FireAllClients(functionName, ...)
```
The onCalculateRequest function will be called on each client, and each client will perform the calculation using the provided arguments. The result will be returned to the server and can be used as needed.
## Conclusion
Using a BindableEvent to offload heavy AI calculations to clients is a powerful technique that can significantly improve game performance. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can start using this technique in your own Roblox games.

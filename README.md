# Multiplayer Game Communication System API Guidelines
---
## Introduction
### The Multiplayer Game Communication System API Guidelines are designed to provide a structure for the development of multiplayer games. These guidelines outline a file and folder structure and provide guidance for client-server communication, security considerations, and best practices for module development.

## File and Folder Structure
### The following file and folder structure is recommended for a multiplayer game communication system:
```
Server
Private/
    index.lua (entry point for the server)
    modules/
        events.lua (module for server-side events)
        functions.lua (module for server-side functions)
    services/
        database.lua (module for handling database interactions)
    assets/
         [various assets]

Shared/
    modules/
        utils.lua (module for commonly used utility functions)
        pathfinding.lua (module for pathfinding algorithms)
        physics.lua (module for handling physics and collisions)
        sound.lua (module for playing sound effects and music)
        animation.lua (module for controlling character animations)
        calculations.lua (module for shared calculations)
        
Client

index.lua (entry point for the client)
modules/
    events.lua (module for client-side events)
    functions.lua (module for client-side functions)
    calculations.lua (module for shared calculations)
services/
    server.lua (module for communicating with the server)
ui/
    [various UI elements]
```

## Communication System
### The following guidelines outline the recommended communication system for a multiplayer game:
* Each client will be assigned its own event and function listener objects.
* These listeners will also be used by the server to listen for signals from the assigned client.
* These listeners will also be used by the client to listen for signals from the server.
* If these listeners are used by another client, this means there has been a security breach. Deny this request and BAN the client which accessed a private listener.
* The server will have a honeypot containing signals with listeners which BAN the requester. Use names such as “Give Money”, “Kill All”, “Admin”. BAN any client which * invokes these listeners.
## Security Considerations
### The following security considerations should be taken into account when developing a multiplayer game:
* Validate the caller's token and event existence before allowing the caller to invoke a function.
* If the caller and event are not valid, kick the caller for attempting to exploit.
* If the caller does not match the player, kick them for attempting to exploit.
* Validate the caller's token and calculation existence before allowing the caller to invoke a calculation.
* If the caller and calculation are not valid, kick the caller for attempting to exploit.
* If a client attempts to use a private listener, deny the request and ban the client.
## Best Practices for Module Development
### The following best practices should be followed when developing modules for a multiplayer game:
* Use a consistent naming convention for modules, functions, and events.
* Place modules in the appropriate folder structure based on their functionality.
* Avoid global variables as they can cause issues with variable scope and conflicts.
* Use the return statement to return values from functions and calculations.
* Use comments to explain the purpose and functionality of functions and calculations.

## Conclusion
The Multiplayer Game Communication System API Guidelines provide a structure for developing multiplayer games. Following these guidelines will help ensure that your game is secure, scalable, and easy to maintain.
